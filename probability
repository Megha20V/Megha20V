Probability 

calculating likelihood of a event to occur


Basics of probability 
    lies between 0(impossible) - 1(certain event)
    
    probabiltiy of event to occur = (no of ways an event can occur)/(total no of outcomes)
    
    
    
    
Random Variables
    Discrete  - only discrete or distinict values
    
    Continuous - may be decimal 
    
    
Probability Distribution 

    

    Normal Distribution
        in data set most of data points lies in middle of the range and less in extrme
    
    Skewness - most of the data points are lied at one extrme 
        negative skewed- points lies away from 0 (right side ) 
        positive skewed- near to 0 (left side)
    
    Poisson Distribution
        how many time an event is likely occur within a specified period of time 
        
        f(x) =(e^λ * λ^x)/x ! 

        Where,
        
        f(x) = probability
        
        x= no of times event occur 

        e is  Elur's number 2.71828 (the base of the logarithm) 


        λ is mean no of events
