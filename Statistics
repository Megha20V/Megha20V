Statistics Implementation with python 2


types of data

1 categoriacal (male,female)
    Nominal (not provide any quantitative eg gender,colour of ball)
    Ordinal  (values follow a natural order eg review of phone)

2 numerical 
    Discrete (not floating values)
    Continuous (have floating values)
    

types of statistics

1 Descriptive statistics (Describe the data)
    data analysis (past data )
    Mean , Median , Mode (Measure of central tendencies)
    Range,Standard Deviation , variance (Measure of variability)


2 Inferential statistics (inference about the data)
    data science (future profit )'
    population 100K ----> sample 10 K
    

Types of statistical study 

1 Sample study (blood sugar level)
    take sample data 
    

2 Observational study  (blood sugar level and physical activity )
    simply collect and analyze data . we don't change
    
    
3 Experimental study (healthy food , regular exercises & unhealthy food , minimal  exercises ) ( maximum group 1 have  optimum blood sugar level )

    conditions are controlled and manipulated by experimenter
    

sample techniques 

probability sampling techniques (all have equal probalility)
    1 simple random sampling  (any random sample )
        pros-(any random sample ) , somple method ,no bias
        cons - data should be high , cannot represent the data well sometimes,
        
    2 systematic sampling (pick data at regular interval of time)
        if it is homogeneous and data points are uniformly distributed
    
        pros - quick and easy , less bias ,
        
        cons - data manipulation risk , require randomness in data 
    
    3 stratified random sampling (data is divided into small groups (strata) and from the groups samples are obtained randomly )
        pros - important characteristics , high precisions if strata is high differences 
        
        cons - cannnot perform that cannot be classified into groups , overlapping of data 
    
    4 cluster sampling
        subdivided into clusters and random clusters(groups) are taken as sample
        pros - few resourses , reduce variability
        
        cons - cannnot perform that cannot be classified into natural groups , overlapping of data ,can't provide a general for entire population 
    
    
    
Non-probability sampling techniques (all do not have equal probalility)



central tendencies
    Mean - sum of observations / total number of observations
        if uniformaly distributed 
    
    Median - middle element in ascending order in odd or (a+b)/2 a,b are middle in even
        if it is skewed(graph) we can use it 
    
    
    Mode - repeated so many times 
        if it is skewed(graph) and missing categorial values we can use it 
        


Measure of variability
    Range - maximum , minimum value  min - max 
    
    
    
    
    variance - sigma(x-mean)^2/total no of values 
        sample variance - sigma(x-mean)^2/(total no of values -1)
    
    
    

    Standard Deviation - square root  of variance




Percentiles and Quantiles

    Percentiles - is value on scale of 100 that indicates the percent of a distribution that is equal to or below it
    
    
    Quantiles - how many values are above or below a certain limit .it divide into equal size subgroups 
    





Correlation and Causation    


Correlation - relation between the features in dataset ,but not one event is cause of the other event 

    positive Correlation - relation is directly proportional
    
    negative Correlation -relation is indirectly proportional



Causation - relation between the features in dataset , one event is cause of the other event 

    



Hypothesis Testing - assumption is made based on data ,and test the assumptions 


Null Hypothesis -commonly accepted fact


Alternative Hypothesis - opposite to null and it challenges the null hypothesis
